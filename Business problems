15 Business problems:

1.	Cancellation rate by vehicle type: Which vehicle types (Go Mini, Sedan, Auto, etc.) see the highest driver- or customer-initiated 
cancellations, and why?
2.	Peak-time cancellation behavior: At what times of day do customers cancel most often vs. drivers cancel most often? 
3.	Cancellation reason clustering:Analyze text reasons and flag common themes—e.g.,pricing complaints,driver delays,location mismatch.
4.	Impact of Avg VTAT & CTAT on cancellations:Is higher wait time (driver arrival or customer arrival) strongly correlated with
cancellation?
5.	Avg VTAT & CTAT by location: Which pickup zones cause chronic driver delays? Geo-level bottleneck detection.
6.	Vehicle utilization analysis: Track incomplete/cancelled rides as a proportion of assigned bookings to estimate wasted vehicle 
capacity.
7.	 Driver rating impact on cancellations: Are rides with drivers who has lower average ratings more likely to have their rides
cancelled by customers?
8.	Customer loyalty vs. payment method: Do wallet/credit card users show higher ride completion rates compared to cash users?
9.	Identify vehicle type who got cancelled excessively and measure their impact on system efficiency.
10.	Revenue leakage due to cancellations: Estimate lost revenue from both customer and driver cancellations.
11.	Profitability by vehicle type: Compare ride value vs. distance across different vehicle categories.
12.	Payment method profitability: Which payment methods correlate with higher-value bookings? (Credit card rides vs. UPI vs. cash.)
13. Temporal ride demand forecasting: Using booking timestamps, forecast high-demand periods to optimize driver supply.
14	Hotspot detection: Identify locations with high booking density but high cancellation rates—prime areas for driver allocation.
15.	Incomplete rides by geography: Which zones are prone to incomplete rides, and what are the cited reasons?
